Next problem - named "Which categories are Important?"


First Page

We now know which features we can root out as not playing a big role in the answer! Correlation helped us spot the weak links among numerical features.
But what if features are categorical?
Things like car brand (Toyota, Honda, BMW), fuel type (Petrol, Diesel, Electric), or transmission (Manual, Automatic)—you can't just "correlate" these. They're categories, not numbers.
So how do you figure out if they actually matter?

Consider the below

A restaurant chain is trying to figure out what drives chef salaries. They've got data on years of experience, critic reviews, cuisine specialization, and what each chef actually earns.


then the data at public\assets\LinearRegression\Anova\data.csv
display beautifully - with emojis and all if possible


then the below text

Two of these features are categorical—they're not numbers, they're labels.

Critic Review: Excellent or Poor
Cuisine: French or Italian


Your task is simple: Look at the data and tell - the salary does NOT seem to depend heavily on which one of these categories?


the options -

The correct answer is Cuisine 

Also keep the See Answer just like before

The remark should be - No matter if you make French or Italian food, if you have experience and critical acclaim, you tend to earn more!

(If wrong option is selected the other one should glow green and this one red and display wrong answer! and the remark - if correct is selected only that option glows green (the other one does NOT glow red) and correct answer! is displayed with remark)

When the patterns are subtle, mathematical ways for deciding whether a categorical feature actually matters.

For binary categories (like Excellent vs Poor), we use T-Tests.
For categories with more than two groups (like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu—the state you belong to), we use ANOVA.


T-test

The t-test is used to compare the averages of two groups to see if they are significantly different from each other

ANOVA

ANOVA is useful when we need to compare more than two groups and determine whether their means are significantly different.

For a categorical feature to be valuable - 

The Ideal case is :

[keep the below quotes dramatic Dramatic]

All target values that fall in one category should be similar to each other.

The mean of the target values in each category should be very different than each other (basically saying that the groups are different)



Next page -


Luckily for us, one easy way is to look at the Box Plot!

A Box Plot first represents various categories as blocks and then represents the range of target values they cover

public\assets\LinearRegression\Anova\plot1.png - Put this image

As you can see -
[Dramatic]
The height of each box shows the range of values covered by that category - a bigger height meaning that the category covers very different target values

The position of each box suggests the difference in target values covered by the categories - overlapping categories essentialy meaning that two different groups are covering the same targets


Next page -

[ From now on answer are either yes or no, we use the same glowing techniques as earlier 
Remark - Wide boxes with overlapping target values are more redundant features ]

[All the below images from path - public\assets\LinearRegression\Anova\]

Looking at the box plot, do you think this feature heavily determines the target value ?


plot2.png

yes/No

Update the stats when finished - Say Hurray! You have finished the exercise. (Take to Module Page)

Do the same hurray thingy for the Drop the Junk page as well

Also the stats are not being updated in the module section in home page

------------------------------------------------------------------


> Ok there are a lot of issues

First of all the first page itself HAS NOT BEEN BEAUTIFIED!!!

In the critic Review or Cuisine selection, the continue button should appear even after        
wrong answer

in anova and t - test keep the resources in a dropdown menu 


In page 6,7,8 - the option that I SELECT IN 6 CONTINUES ONTO THE 7 AND 8!! - CORRECT THIS      
!! I SHOULD BE ABLE TO SELECT DIFFERENT OPTIONS IN DIFFERENT PAGES!!!

Also the answer sequence is Yes, No, Yes

The 9th page takes you TO THE LANDING PAGE!!! CORRECT IT!!! IT SHOULD TAKE ME TO THE PARENT    
 MODULE PAGE WHICH IS THE LINEAR REGRESSION PAGE!!!
