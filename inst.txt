listen I want two
  features to be
  implemented here

  1. I want a leaderboard -  
  and that should show       
  actual accounts - the      
  rule  - the person who has completed more problems and faster

  2. On clicking I should be able to see the profiles!! - Which would be basically same as the home page (not the landing page) without the modules section

For doing this I would like to implement an approach that would look good on my resume for the sde placements -

I want to use sql with posgresql using neon db

Make sure that u follow the principles of SCALABILITY, SYSTEM DESIGN AND DEPLOYABILITY!!!
