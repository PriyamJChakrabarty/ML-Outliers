✨ML Outliers - Platform for building ML intuition through visualization ✨

So I've seen a LOT of ML learners 🎓
do this:

Get a dataset 📊
Do some basic EDA
And then... "Let's just try ALL
the models and see what works!" 🤷

This is not generally what we
expect from ML Engineers. ⚠️
This project is built to fix
exactly that ✨ - Make you understand what
models to use, when to use
them and how to use them to
get the best outcomes !


The project brushes up on Data Science
fundamentals + deeper insights into ML Algos 🔍
Remember -  ⚠️ WE ARE NOT TRAINING MODELS ⚠️

Here, we work with:
Graphs 📈
Visualizations 🎨
Small exercises 🧠

The aim is to build your ML
Intuition 💡 - so you can look at data
and instantly get a sense of what might work or how to tweak things to make it work better! 🎯
