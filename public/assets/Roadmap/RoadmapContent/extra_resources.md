Template for Financial Aid application



Being an undergraduate student of Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad in my 1st year majoring in Information Technology. My major being Information Technology and keen interest in Artificial Intelligence and machine learning, therefore this course will help me a lot in developing the necessary skill set that will help me achieve my dream. I want to start career in Artificial Intelligence which needs Deep Learning skillsets, which can be great for my career. That is why I need this financial aid.

This course will provide me with a solid foundation in the principles and concepts of machine learning.Moreover, the course emphasizes hands-on experience through practical assignments and projects. By working on real-world problems and implementing machine learning algorithms, I will develop practical skills that are highly valued in the industry. This hands-on approach will enhance my ability to apply machine learning techniques to solve diverse challenges across different domains.

I will commit to all the deadlines put before me and will try my best to complete the course. As a tech enthusiast and researcher, I want to learn Artificial Intelligence and Image processing.
