Section 1

The overall roadmap goes as follows - Initially you must learn the basics of python language followed by the important libraries of Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn



NumPy and Pandas handle the data cleaning and preprocessing, Matplotlib and Seaborn are the standard tools for visualisation.



Then we can move on to traditional ML Algorithms in sequence Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Trees, Ensemble Models like Random Forest & XGBoost.


Then we can move on to Deep Learning & Neural Networks concepts like Perceptron & ANN, CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU, Transfomers etc

This prepares a strong foundation for you to explore the amazing world of AI/ML with projects!
